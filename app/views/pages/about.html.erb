				<p style="font-size:18px; padding-top:10px; margin-bottom:40px;">I have also done some programming in the back-end programming languages of PHP and Ruby On Rails.
				<br />
				<br />
				I am a self-taught programmer and have been coding for the past two-and-a-half years. I endeavor to create websites that are visually pleasing and give the best user experience possible.
				<br />
				<br />
				I have also spent time working with the Swift language to build apps for iOS devices such as the iPhone and iPad. I have a number of apps in the App Store.  You will find some of the projects I've created on the <span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:18px;"><%= link_to("Portfolio", {:action => "portfolio"}) %></a></span> page.

				I am currently based in Winchester, Hampshire in Southern England and I'm available for freelance work. Should you wish to contact me, then please visit the <span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:18px;"><%= link_to("Contact", {:action => "contact"}) %></a></span> page for details of how to do so.</p>
